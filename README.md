### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoc at the University of Trento. My research focuses on individual decision making in behavioral economics framework. In particular, I am interested in using experimental methods to study intertemporal choice. My research interests include vulnerability, psychology of poverty, and behavioral public policy.

I am currently working on psychophysiological measures in food consumer science.
